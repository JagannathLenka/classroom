Hi Aishwarya. I am fairy. I live in the forest. I come to meet you. I think you are a good girl. Do you want to be my friend?
I will tell ou a story.

Long long ago there was a little girl. Her name is Mash. She had a friend, a bear. The bear was very friendly. One day the bear went to get some fish from river. Mash was looking for the bear. A little bunny said, bear is at the river. Suddenly the bear slipped in the water.

The little girl took some help from all the animals and saved the bear. Then they were very happy.

Fox said I want to go in the water too. I can swim. I will not go too far. But  Aishwarya was very angry. She said, I do not want to play with you. Go away. Fox was very upset and went away. Then Aishwarya was playing happily.
